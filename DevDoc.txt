Meeting 11/28/20
In today's meeting, the group discussed the present issues and goals we wanted to tackle as we leave fall break. Kevin demonstrated and explained his current code with the help of curl/JSON to parse data from Spotify. The overall decision is to ***not*** create a visual graph implementation, (too difficult,) but to instead create a terminal-based system of calling the code with a couple parameters to produce a "graph" based on a specific artists. For example: "./main Jacob Collier 5" creates a graph based on the artist Jacob Collier with a degree of 5 away from him. Another suggestion made is to potentially use std::cin to allow for specific searching of an artist. For example, from Jacob Collier, the user would be asked to pick another artist from a list of "first degree" artists.
